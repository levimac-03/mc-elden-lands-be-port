Welcome to the **<span style="color:red;">Elden Lands</span>** port. This repository features the mystical world of Elden Lands, originally built for Java Edition, now accessible on Bedrock Edition.

## How The Conversion Was Achieved

This conversion was successfully completed using **Amulet V0.10.35** to ensure compatibility with Bedrock Edition. The version ported is **Elden Lands v2.3**, the latest version. To learn more about the tool, visit [Amulet's official website](https://www.amuletmc.com/).

## Why Use Amulet?

Amulet was chosen instead of JE2BE for several key reasons:

- **Chunk-Level Customization:** Vital for managing the detailed and extensive terrain of Elden Lands.
- **Entity Preservation:** Guarantees the proper transfer of entities and tile entities during conversion.
- **NBT Support:** Maintains all important map attributes throughout the process.

Although JE2BE works for basic conversions, Amulet provides the necessary depth and control for a complex map like Elden Lands.
